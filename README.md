# Marshmello (temporary placeholder name)
This project is currently in it first iteration.

### What is this project?
This is a project for term 2 SPD class at Make School. The objectives of that class were to partner up with a classmate and then develop an app.

I wrote a Medium article summarizing my experience [here](https://medium.com/@mintri1199/a-beginner-story-of-app-development-7e085d090af3)

### What does it do?

The main function of this app is to gamifying exploration to encourage people to go outside more. It will show places of interest around the user that are within walking distance. It will show pictures and a brief description, and direction of the selected place.

When the user arrive at the selected location, they will earn points that allow them to spend on cosmetic for the in app mascot.
